Me and SOFe discussion summary:
Use virtual accounts where users can have multiple accounts. Accounts are stored by accountID. Accounts have liomits on the amount of money that can be stored. Plugins that use XialotAPI will have to register which account money goes to (from mining and such) or they will get an error.
